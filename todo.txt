Make a spellitem that gives the player a random Tome spell; can be found in chests only and dropped by bosses.

Add an item after making all the boons that drops from any and all mobs, it's a grimoire with a random boon inside that gives the player that boon when they use the item. 
This boon is represented as a name tag item and the item they got it from will be used (consumed) upon use.
